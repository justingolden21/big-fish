do:

- add upgrades
- figure out aquarium display
	- hungry fish images, scroll through different aquariums?
	- get rid of aquarium look alltogether
	- each fish has unique aquarium number? draw in that number aquarium if that one is the one being displayed
	- draw a random 100 of the fish each time?

maybe:
disable buttons for things you cant purchase in updateUI()
add commas to numbers

later:
sync data with google account/loggin api
add rest of features (upgrades, achievements)
add help modal about how to play
add info modal about version number, contact info, fontawesome credits, donate, share game
optimize fish data strcutres for redundancy
use sass


bugs:
handle opening a snackbar when another is already open


console/history of notifications/of unlocks


display stats like num_ticks and total purchased fish, total eaten fish, money made by small fish, etc


choose how many fish hatcheries are running
discount 10% for buy in bulk?
	sell farms and hatcheries



game progress:
limited room for buildings? buy more land? aquariums count too?

stupid dimension: monsters that eat aquariums
	- hunger based off of fish in aquarium?
	- later game challenges such as hunger killing fish, events that kill fish
