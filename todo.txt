do:
big changes:
rename producers into buildings
hatchery factory:
1,000,000 for medium fish hatchery factory, produces 1 per second
100,000,000 for big fish hatchery factory, produces 1 per second

land mechanic:
start with 1,000,000 land (1 land unit)
aquariums take up 1 land units
farms take 10, small hatchery 100, medium hatchery 1000, big hatchery 10000, aquarium factory 100,000
medium fish hatchery factory 1,000,000, big fish hatchery factory 10,000,000
land upgrades cost 1,000,000,000 coin for 1 land unit of land
land factory (tank?) costs 1,000,000,000,000 coins and makes 1 land unit per second and takes up 1,000,000,000 land

autosell item/feature:
autosell building:
costs 100,000 coin, takes 10,000 land, sells 1 thing per second, drop downs and number inputs of how many of what to sell per second

================================================================

todo:
load the consts in index on pageload (the ones in my stuff section)

achievement idea: get to certain coins/second

add fontawesome checkbox and option to remove accent
checkbox for drawing aquarium at bottom

download and upload data as .txt or .json, maybe encode it?
use cookies?

================================================================

maybe:
add upgrades
reflavor money into smiles?
restart the game but with better costs once you get to certain point?
fish that eats aquariums?
disable buttons for things you cant purchase in updateUI()
add commas to numbers
discount 10% for buy in bulk?
hungry fish images?
add keyboard controls for purcahses



later:
sync data with google account/loggin api
collabertation with other players? online multiplayer? hmm
add rest of features (upgrades, achievements)
optimize fish data strcutres for redundancy
use sass

variable in check unlocks called checkingForUnlocks and set to true at beginning of function
if set to false then unlocks dont run so that one unlock per that many ticks maybe have timeout function for setting to false instead of beginning of function

bugs:
handle opening a snackbar when another is already open
fish.ticks still doesn't work? but .hungry does?

game progress:
stupid dimension: monsters that eat aquariums
	- hunger based off of fish in aquarium?
	- later game challenges such as hunger killing fish, events that kill fish
