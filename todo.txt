do:

- add upgrades
- hungry fish images?

variable in check unlocks called checkingForUnlocks and set to true at beginning of function
if set to false then unlocks dont run so that one unlock per that many ticks maybe have timeout function for setting to false instead of beginning of function

limited room for buildings? buy more land? aquariums count too?

- console/history modal of notifications/of unlocks

================================================================

maybe:
disable buttons for things you cant purchase in updateUI()
add commas to numbers
add icons to snackbar for unlocks?
discount 10% for buy in bulk?

later:
sync data with google account/loggin api
add rest of features (upgrades, achievements)
optimize fish data strcutres for redundancy
use sass

bugs:
handle opening a snackbar when another is already open
fish.ticks still doesn't work? but .hungry does?

game progress:
stupid dimension: monsters that eat aquariums
	- hunger based off of fish in aquarium?
	- later game challenges such as hunger killing fish, events that kill fish



redo unlock system so in index stuff with unlock has class for example .medium-fish-unlock
