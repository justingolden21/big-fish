do:

hatchery factory
autosell item/feature?
- add land space
limited room for buildings? buy more land? aquariums count too?


todo:
load the consts in index on pageload (the ones in my stuff section)

achievement idea: get to certain coins/second

add fontawesome checkbox and option to remove accent
checkbox for drawing aquarium at bottom

download and upload data as .txt or .json, maybe encode it?
use cookies?

================================================================

maybe:
add upgrades
reflavor money into smiles?
restart the game but with better costs once you get to certain point?
fish that eats aquariums?
disable buttons for things you cant purchase in updateUI()
add commas to numbers
discount 10% for buy in bulk?
hungry fish images?
add keyboard controls for purcahses



later:
sync data with google account/loggin api
collabertation with other players? online multiplayer? hmm
add rest of features (upgrades, achievements)
optimize fish data strcutres for redundancy
use sass

variable in check unlocks called checkingForUnlocks and set to true at beginning of function
if set to false then unlocks dont run so that one unlock per that many ticks maybe have timeout function for setting to false instead of beginning of function

bugs:
handle opening a snackbar when another is already open
fish.ticks still doesn't work? but .hungry does?

game progress:
stupid dimension: monsters that eat aquariums
	- hunger based off of fish in aquarium?
	- later game challenges such as hunger killing fish, events that kill fish
