================================BUGS:================================
clearing cookies doesn't work?...

fix bug with banks selling items when you dont have enough so it goes down by 1 each time

	(goes negative if not enough cash and purchasing multiple items)

================================TODO:================================

reflavor money into smiles?

sync data with google account/loggin api
use sharethis and realfavicongenerator.net

================================MAYBE:================================
add upgrades

restart the game but with better costs once you get to certain point?
fish that eats aquariums?
disable buttons for things you cant purchase in updateUI()
add commas to numbers, abreviations for mill, bill, trill...
discount 10% for buy in bulk?
hungry fish images?
add keyboard controls for purcahses

================================TODO LATER:================================
collabertation with other players? online multiplayer?
optimize fish data strcutres for redundancy
use sass
encode .txt files so they cant be easily messed with
store data more accuratly in cookies and .txt files.
have date on txt files?
================================BIG IDEAS:================================
penguins:
cost 1bil coins, eat 100 big fish/s
every min give you 1 snowflake
snowflakesmultiply the amount of coins you earn
after 1st penguin next penguin costs 1 snowflake, then 2 then 3...

penguin hatchery that costs 10, then 20, then 30 snowflake and makes 1 penguin per min?

big changes:
rename producers into buildings

hatchery factory:
1,000,000 for medium fish hatchery factory, produces 1 per second
100,000,000 for big fish hatchery factory, produces 1 per second

land mechanic:
start with 1,000,000 land (1 land unit)
aquariums take up 1 land units
farms take 10, small hatchery 100, medium hatchery 1000, big hatchery 10000, aquarium factory 100,000
medium fish hatchery factory 1,000,000, big fish hatchery factory 10,000,000
land upgrades cost 1,000,000,000 coin for 1 land unit of land
land factory (tank?) costs 1,000,000,000,000 coins and makes 1 land unit per second and takes up 1,000,000,000 land
bank takes 10,000 land

late game progress:
monsters that eat aquariums
- hunger based off of fish in aquarium?
- later game challenges such as hunger killing fish, events that kill fish
