================================BUGS:================================
fix bug with banks selling items when you dont have enough so it goes down by 1 each time
================================TODO:================================
- remember/store settings in cookies, txt file

- more efficient way of storing fish/penguins that arent displayed (dont need x, y coords for all 1000000 fish, only the top 20, and you sell the bottom ones first. check how many fish before assigning coords? before moving?)

- checkbox to display buy max possible buttons

- sync data with google account/loggin api

- use sharethis and realfavicongenerator.net

- add sound for success btn click, not just hover

================================BUGS:================================
potential bug: with snowflakes and banks displayed coin rate might be calcualted wrong
coin rate caluated wrong doesnt account for fish eating before they die
	important because when you have a bunch of hatcheries and penguins and no fish that live
	it displays 0 but increases
================================MAYBE:================================
option to change aesthetic/theme: default, simple, gradient
add upgrades
achievement idea: get to certain coins/second
restart the game but with better costs once you get to certain point?
fish that eats aquariums?
disable buttons for things you cant purchase in updateUI()
add commas to numbers, abreviations for mill, bill, trill...
discount 10% for buy in bulk?
hungry fish images?
add keyboard controls for purcahses
show graphs of food and fish and money vs ticks?
different colored snackbars for unlocks and warnings
add option to inrease the number of an item purhased or sold by a certain value in banks
help i broke it and i need a few extra coins button, to give plus one coin
idea: have random events, such that you gain or lose resources, have thing go on "sale", more changes to gameplay to make less linear and more unexpected.
options for sound effects: purchasing and error sounds, unlock and achievement sound
button to clear queue of notifications to display? pause to clear?
use cookies for sound setting
load the consts in index on pageload (the ones in my stuff section), better quality code
penguins dont take up aquarium space, they take up snow space? buildings take up land space?
make it a pwa
================================TODO LATER:================================
collabertation with other players? online multiplayer?
optimize fish data structres for redundancy
use sass
encode .txt files so they cant be easily messed with
store data more accuratly in cookies and .txt files.
have date on txt files?
================================BIG IDEAS:================================
penguins:
cost 1bil coins, eat 100 big fish/s
every min give you 1 snowflake
snowflakesmultiply the amount of coins you earn
after 1st penguin next penguin costs 1 snowflake, then 2 then 3...

penguin hatchery that costs 10, then 20, then 30 snowflake and makes 1 penguin per min?

something that eats snowflakes? eats penguins?

big changes:
rename producers into buildings

hatchery factory:
1,000,000 for medium fish hatchery factory, produces 1 per second
100,000,000 for big fish hatchery factory, produces 1 per second

land mechanic:
start with 1,000,000 land (1 land unit)
aquariums take up 1 land units
farms take 10, small hatchery 100, medium hatchery 1000, big hatchery 10000, aquarium factory 100,000
medium fish hatchery factory 1,000,000, big fish hatchery factory 10,000,000
land upgrades cost 1,000,000,000 coin for 1 land unit of land
land factory (tank?) costs 1,000,000,000,000 coins and makes 1 land unit per second and takes up 1,000,000,000 land
bank takes 10,000 land

late game progress:
monsters that eat aquariums
- hunger based off of fish in aquarium?
- later game challenges such as hunger killing fish, events that kill fish
- hard mode option where fish die after 5s of being hungry?
