penguin notes:

penguins cost increasing number of snowflakes, starting at 1, increase by 1 per penguin
penguins produce 1 snowflake per min
penguins eat 100 big fish/s
penguins take up 10000 aquarium space

snowflakes multiply your coin increase by number of snowflakes, for fish only

penguins only produce snowflakes if they've eaten 100*60 big fish

unlocked after having 10000 big fish

penguins can be returned for 1 snowflake

penguin hatcheries cost 100, 200, 300 snowflakes

later:
penguin banks: use snowflakes as currency, dynamically buy penguins or penguin hatcheries
banks let you trade 100,000,000 coins for 1 snowflake, up to 10 times per min per bank
