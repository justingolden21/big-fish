penguin notes:

penguins cost increasing number of snowflakes, starting at 1, increase by 1 per penguin
penguins produce 1 snowflake per min
penguins eat 100 big fish/s
penguins take up 10000 aquarium space

snowflakes multiply your coin increase by number of snowflakes, for fish only

penguins only produce snowflakes if they've eaten 100*60 big fish

unlocked after having 10000 big fish

penguins can be returned for 1 snowflake

later:
add penguin hatcheries, penguin banks, all use snowflakes as currency
