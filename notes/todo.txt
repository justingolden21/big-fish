================================NOTE:================================
still need to bug test a LOT on every aspect of the game due to the large number of changes to many files
================================TO TEST:================================
need to test download and upload files remembering medium fish and puffer hatcheries
also need to test aesthetic
test loading from file and not unlocking ability to sell until buying fish
================================GRAPHIC UPDATES TODO:================================
NEED TO make so if your fish are eaten then you hatch new ones, they dont seem to teleport (cause theyre different fish) remember previous x and y coords? facing left and subtype?
================================BIG NEWS:================================
change pufferfishes to a type of fish, make the canvas just one canvas, delete pufferfish sprites and related info and change for whatever type of fish
================================BIG IDEAS:================================
make sprite system all in one file
add vectors too and update icon etc
add credit to font and sprites not just readme but also modal in site
show shells being dropped
fix for running out of shells?
draw fish more often than game tick?
display fish as skeleton if hungry, if over 20 fish, display a percentage equal to hungry percentage out of 20 as hungry sprites
shells randomly spawn in the sand? click them to get a shell and turn sand to normal sand?
================================BUGS:================================
medium fish aren't unlocked from file
achievement tab isn't unlocked form file
fix bug with banks selling items when you dont have enough so it goes down by 1 each time
figure out checkbox with tabbation/tab key/focus
================================TODO:================================
- remember/store settings in cookies, txt file

- remember/store unlocks (in case you unlocked it before but wouldn't have unlocked it now) (also so we don't display a million notifications about unlocks on loading save)

- remember previous banks buy/sell inputs in cookies/txt

- more efficient way of storing fish/pufferfishes that arent displayed (dont need x, y coords for all 1000000 fish, only the top 20, and you sell the bottom ones first. check how many fish before assigning coords? before moving?)

- checkbox to display buy max possible buttons

- sync data with google account/loggin api

- use sharethis and realfavicongenerator.net

- add sound for success btn click, not just hover

- system for displaying locked achievements that aren't spoilers

- figure out system for less annoying/more fun upon page load. cookie alert is annoying, lack of music is boring.
================================BUGS:================================
potential bug: with stars and banks displayed shell rate might be calcualted wrong
shell rate caluated wrong doesnt account for fish eating before they die
	important because when you have a bunch of hatcheries and pufferfishes and no fish that live
	it displays 0 but increases
needs testing (unsure if fixed): when background music changes, update dropdown in settings too
================================GRAPHICAL BUGS:================================

================================MAYBE:================================
make sand go all the way to bottom of screen on larger screens

option to change aesthetic/theme: default, simple, gradient
add upgrades
bank gives better deal on selling/buying?
achievement idea: get to certain shells/second
restart the game but with better costs once you get to certain point?
fish that eats aquariums?
disable buttons for things you cant purchase in updateUI()
add commas to numbers, abreviations for mill, bill, trill...
discount 10% for buy in bulk?
hungry fish images?
add keyboard controls for purcahses
show graphs of food and fish and money vs ticks?
different colored snackbars for unlocks and warnings
add option to inrease the number of an item purhased or sold by a certain value in banks
help i broke it and i need a few extra shells button, to give plus one shell
idea: have random events, such that you gain or lose resources, have thing go on "sale", more changes to gameplay to make less linear and more unexpected.
options for sound effects: purchasing and error sounds, unlock and achievement sound
button to clear queue of notifications to display? pause to clear?
use cookies for sound setting
load the consts in index on pageload (the ones in my stuff section), better quality code
pufferfishes dont take up aquarium space, they take up snow space? buildings take up land space?
make it a pwa
================================TODO LATER:================================
collabertation with other players? online multiplayer?
optimize fish data structres for redundancy
use sass
encode .txt files so they cant be easily messed with
store data more accuratly in cookies and .txt files.
have date on txt files?
================================BIG IDEAS:================================
pufferfishes:
cost 1bil shells, eat 100 big fish/s
every min give you 1 star
starsmultiply the amount of shells you earn
after 1st pufferfish next pufferfish costs 1 star, then 2 then 3...

pufferfish hatchery that costs 10, then 20, then 30 star and makes 1 pufferfish per min?

something that eats stars? eats pufferfishes?

big changes:
rename producers into buildings

hatchery factory:
1,000,000 for medium fish hatchery factory, produces 1 per second
100,000,000 for big fish hatchery factory, produces 1 per second

land mechanic:
start with 1,000,000 land (1 land unit)
aquariums take up 1 land units
farms take 10, small hatchery 100, medium hatchery 1000, big hatchery 10000, aquarium factory 100,000
medium fish hatchery factory 1,000,000, big fish hatchery factory 10,000,000
land upgrades cost 1,000,000,000 shell for 1 land unit of land
land factory (tank?) costs 1,000,000,000,000 shells and makes 1 land unit per second and takes up 1,000,000,000 land
bank takes 10,000 land

late game progress:
monsters that eat aquariums
- hunger based off of fish in aquarium?
- later game challenges such as hunger killing fish, events that kill fish
- hard mode option where fish die after 5s of being hungry?
